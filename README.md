# GitHub-Runner-Setup

NOT FOR USE WITH PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!

Simple BASH script to set up a github runner with required docker components

This script should only be used for reference or after careful examination! It has no error handling or selfchecks and assumes the user knows what they are doing!

You will need: A VM with Ubuntu 20.x, a project hosted on Github, and the project runner key
